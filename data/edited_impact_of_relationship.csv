Early in the semester my mentor suggested I apply for REU internships for the summer. They were a great help in my applications, and I got exactly the internship I wanted (though I applied to many others). 
During the semester I went to the UCUR and NCUR conferences to present the project, and my mentor was a great help in reviewing the poster and helping me plan. They were especially helpful in planning the trip to California to attend NCUR.
I have not been as proactive as I could have been in keeping up with my mentor this semester. But that is my own fault and nothing to do with them.",10741827,Austen,Miller,10741827@uvu.edu,S,SR,Bioinformatics,BS-BIOI,M,144,2022,2,
